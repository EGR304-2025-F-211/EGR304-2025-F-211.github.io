<td>We bought this switch to replace the mechanical one in the garage, since we were all too often leaving it on all day after driving out. This switch was easy to wire, looks good for a motion sensor, and more importantly, it just works every time. Now we never need to think about lighting when leaving or coming home; the garage is always well-lit when we need it to be.</td>

<td>Installation instructions are not included with the package. What you do get is a QR code, where you are required to log in to the Lutron web site to find them. So if there is no Internet access where you are doing the installation, you are SOL. Plus reading them on an iPhone or equivalent, and having to navigate from page to page on a tiny device while juggling your tools isn't ideal. All this aggravation for the buyer to save the negligible cost of including paper instructions in the package. Really?</td>

<td>Both freezers are now monitored 24/7 after freezer door left open and I lost lots of $$. Alarms are configured for temperature outside of range that you set. I can see temps on my iPhone when I’m not home. Best item I have purchased in a long time. So easy to setup that this senior had no issues. Love love love!</td>

<td>It is very handy to have the readings sent to the app. This thermometer gives you the peace of mind that your food won't be thawing. Easy to use/understand the functions on the app. You can set your own temp alarms to alert you when you feel the temp would be too warm. You can set a time frame to get the alert in case you are in and out of the freezer a lot on a given day. It gives you readings of past hours, weeks, months. Happy with the purchase.</td>

<td>If you're renting this is a must have for if or when your landlord special apartment doesn't want to acknowledge issues. Great to have if your fridge is having issues to be able to show maintenance time stamps of when the issues start. Anytime we've run into a hiccup with any Govee product their customer service is amazing.</td>

<td>The wire does not conform to my freezer seal. Our alarm kept going off leading us to think there was a problem with our freezer. We paid Frigidaire $350 for a guaranteed fix and the technician proved the wire was breaking the seal enough where warm air was getting in and causing the temperature to spike. He moved the monitor and our problem was solved. Ironic that the issue this alarm caused me was more expensive than the problem I was trying to prevent.</td>

<td>We have had numerous leaks in our home. It’s all part of homeownership but these give us a little peace of mind. Very easy to set up. Literally put batteries in, set them in areas you may experience a leak. The app works great too. If it detects water, the device itself alarms (loudly) and the app alerts you too! Nice to have if you’re not home. It comes with a “home” unit that simply plugs into a standard outlet and receives the signal from the individual sensors. I placed one under the kitchen sink, near the water heater, and under a bathroom sink. They are a good value for the money and have a slick design.</td>

<td>Honestly this was super easy to setup and is amazingly accurate! I dropped a couple of drips on it and it immediately worked and sent alerts to my phone, email and did the audible tone. It connected easily to the WiFi and is super durable. This is a great product!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>It works- I was leaving to run some errands and the alarms went off on my phone, I really thought it must be a false alarm- sweat from the pipes or something but I went back home and it was a real flood- pipe leak flooding the basement, the alarms on the units were going off - I would recommend these alarms.</td>

<td>Buyer beware! I bought two of these based on the reviews I read on Amazon. When I received them, it was impossible to connect them to my Wi-Fi network, and continue to be impossible, even though I researched it online. To add insult to injury, when I set up the return, I noticed they did not refund the entire amount, but charged me $20 for shipping. Disgraceful and the seller should refund the entire amount or Amazon should refund it. I won’t be duped again.</td>

<tr>
<td>I never got around to installing or testing the actual sensor. The gateway emits a high-pitched noise when the blue light is on (always once connected to wi-fi) that was unbearable (turn up the volume on the video, it's subtle, but very annoying). This may be ok for some people if the gateway is in a room that isn't accessed often, but my gateway would have been in an area that we spend at leased some time exercising in. I ordered the H5058's instead and they seem to work fine.</td>

<td>This product feels well designed and made. The installation takes some effort and patience to fit all the sensors in the electrical panel. One certainly want to make sure clearly label everything. Once installed, it works fairly well. The software is pretty easy to use and the usage numbers are pretty close to my power bill. I really like its integration with Home Assistant.</td>

<td>Only been using this smart home energy monitor for a few weeks and it seems to be working well so far. It is nice to be able to see the energy consumption for your home. Installation seemed to be straightforward, and anything I had trouble figuring out was answered in the installation manual. However, after installation and looking at the readings on my app, they seemed to be showing up with negative values, indicating that the circuit sensors were installed backwards. Luckily, I found out that you can adjust the circuit factors to -1 to reverse the reading to show positive consumption. Also, during the installation, I tried to pull out the Wi-Fi antenna from the module after unscrewing it and it broke off. The construction of the antenna seems to be very fragile. It would be nice if this was constructed with more durability to prevent this. I ended up purchasing a replacement antenna and it worked.</td>

<td>The app for this product is garbage. It has little to no functionailty. It is hard to name your channels as the appliances/circuits you are monitoring. You are unable to combine 240 V devices on two different phases into a combined output. The circuit multiplier screen on the app is very glichy, and doesn't work. When you want to output the data to a spreadsheet it doesn't carry over the names of your circuits, but just A1, B1, C1 as generic descriptions. Because of how the device is designed you can only monitor 5 devices on one phase of your panel, and then the remaining 11 channels have to monitor only devices on the remaining phase. For example if you have 7 devices on the A phase you want to monitor, and 6 devices on theB phase you have to pick the top circuits because you have to choose 5 on one and 11 on the other. Therefore you can't choose the top 16 devices you want to monitor.</td>

<td>Once installed the monitor did a good job at what it says it will do. Initially, I was going to install this in our house however, there simply was not enough room in our electrical panel for that to happen so I opted to install it at my parent's house as they have more room in their panel. As other reviews have stated the direction in which the clamps need to be facing is incorrect according the manual and arrows on the clamps themselves, but this is a simple fix. The manual could be improved a bit as needed to do a bit of research to determine exactly which instructions to follow. It would be nice if they app could have an overview with charts for overall circuit usage. Where you can see how much each circuit is contributing to the overall power usage, but maybe this will come with time. Overall, it works and does what it says it will. I was able to successfully install it, however, I can easily see how it might be too complicated for others, and so professional installation might be needed by an electrician.</td>

<td>I’m really happy with the Moen Flo Smart Water Shutoff Valve. It gives me peace of mind knowing that if there is ever a leak, it will automatically shut the water off before any damage happens. The app makes it simple to check water usage and I get instant notifications if something unusual is going on. The unit itself feels sturdy and well built, so I know it will last. Installation took a little effort, but once it was in place everything worked perfectly. The app is easy to use and makes managing alerts straightforward. Overall this has been a great purchase and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants extra protection for their home and an easy way to monitor water use.</td>

<tr>
<td>The installation was straightforward if you know basic plumbing, sizing, etc. the app setup was a breeze and I am hoping this saves me from any more water damage. My whole downstairs flooded and I bought this to help prevent that from happening again. I love that it gives you PSI counts, the GPM counts, and also the temperature of the water. It is currently still “learning” my habits for our family and I hope it works as good as it says. This links right up to my ring dashboard as well for easy on and off. I added an image to show that I installed it right after my main shut off valve in case I need to do any warranty claims for it. I also recommend doing the $5 a month for 5 year warranty on the device.</td>

<td>I had this installed five years ago, and it truly saved us while we were on vacation. We were on a 7-day cruise when a pipe burst upstairs at 3:37 AM, causing water to pour out from the bathroom. Thankfully, the system detected the issue, shut off the water to the entire house, and immediately alerted us—first by text, then with a phone call. This gave us a chance to check whether it was a false alarm. I quickly pulled up our hallway camera and saw water gushing from the bathroom, flooding our wood floors. But thanks to the Flo, the damage was limited. Just imagine if water had been running like that for the entire week—we would’ve come home to a disaster. I can’t tell you how relieved I was. I recommend this to everyone. Funny enough, I told all my family and close friends, but not one of them ended up installing it. Oh well. Just a heads-up—this unit can be installed outdoors, but I protected mine with an enclosure to shield it from the Florida sun and rain. Hopefully, that gives you an idea for how to protect yours too.</td>

<td>On the surface, the Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff Valve seems like a great idea — a device that prevents water damage by monitoring for leaks. However, after using it for over a year (forced by my insurance company), I’ve realized it's a crude product with a simplistic design and a surprisingly unintelligent software system. The device frequently generates false alarms, causing more inconvenience than protection. For example, my wife and daughter were taking showers after returning from Japan, and the device decided that was “abnormal” usage and shut off our entire home’s water. Another time, I was woken up at 3 AM because it thought our regular sprinkler system was unusual activity. And during visits from guests, the water was abruptly turned off. Worse yet, the system gives the user no meaningful control or customization. Only the user truly understands what’s normal for their household. Water use varies daily, but this device forces rigid, one-size-fits-all rules that often don’t reflect reality. To make matters worse, the device requires constant power and internet access, which are not always available where your main water line enters the home. Meeting these requirements can be very costly, especially if electrical outlets or Wi-Fi coverage need to be extended or upgraded just for this device. In summary, this device is frustrating, intrusive, expensive to install, and poorly thought out. It doesn't make your home smarter — it just makes daily life more complicated.</td>

<td>I bought the Flo device in 2021, at that time it made a lot of sense to have something that would watch over water flow, catch leaks and drips, and notify me. The installation, by a professional plumber, cost more than the price of the device itself, but I wanted it done right, considering it was going to control the main water supply to our home. It worked well for a couple of years, then started malfunctioning (such as leak alarms when there were none, etc). We were away from home for some time and chose to turn the valve off but left the device on. On return, it would not open when signaled on the app. Tech Support was not able to operate the valve remotely either. They asked me to me to open it manually, which I did. If I wanted continued monitoring, Tech Support advised me to buy a new device as well as an extended warrantee. I decided to live with it, because at that time, the flow monitoring part was working fine, and in case there was a problem, I would still get the alert, just not able to shut it off remotely. The other day, I started getting alerts that the device was off line. Upon checking I could see that it had power, but the power connector was filled with water, and the box itself was quite warm. I pulled off the power supply, dried the connector and plugged it back in. The device was totally dead. This was disappointing. I dont expect a mission-critical device, which controls water flow into the house, to die in 3 years. I would not recommend it, because it is not reliable, and after spending over 1.4K for the device and install, I don't expect it to fail so soon.</td>

<td>Another good reason why this product has such a low rating: It is very important that you read their documents, you are giving away too many rights! It is a binding contract! This product is controlling the water supply to your home! The only way you can read the terms and conditions to use the app and connected products is to download the Moen Flo-Smart Water Monitor app on your phone, go through some procedures, and then good luck trying to read the tiny print of the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for the Moen Mobile Applications and Connected Products on your phone. I called Moen to request a link (can’t find it online) so I can read it on my computer. I also printed it up, 13 pages of double-space 12 font text. Some examples: Section 6 (i): “You are giving Moen and its designees perpetual, irrevocable…..right to exploit the User Content and any person’s property (physical, personal, and indicia) contained therein……without any payment or other consideration of any kind…..” Section 9. Warranty and Limitation of Liability: THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THE CONTENT ARE MADE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE ON “AS-IS,” “AS AVAILABLE” AND “"WITH ALL FAULTS BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. I wasted a lot of my time researching the product, wasted a plumber’s time to come out and tell me how much to install it, packing it up to send it back, and gave up reading the rest of this nonsense. There has to be a better product out there.</td>
