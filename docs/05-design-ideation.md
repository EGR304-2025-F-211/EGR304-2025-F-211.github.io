## Generating Ideas

For each user need and product requirement, brainstorm 5 different product features that could be used to satisfy that requirement.

|                   requirement / need |             feature              | detail                                                                      |
| -----------------------------------: | :------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The device has a battery-charge indicator |              RGB LED              | the device has a single RGB LED to reflect charge. Green light means full charge, yellow meaning half charge, and red being almost dead. |
| The device has a battery-charge indicator |             LCD              | The device has a LCD screen that displays charge as a percentage. |
| The device has a battery-charge indicator |             LED              | The device has a red LED blinks to indicate low battery, but is otherwise inactive. |
| The device has a battery-charge indicator |             Buzzer              | The device beeps when low on charge. |
| The device has a battery-charge indicator |             LEDs              | The device has a row of 3 LEDs, if all 3 are lit the device is fully charged, if 2 are lit it is at half charge, and if one is lit the device is low charge. |
| The device is easy to store |             Foldable              | The device can fold to a smaller size for convienent storage. |
| The device is easy to store |             Small size              | The device is smaller than a cubic foot. |
| The device is easy to store |             Storage case              | The device comes with a case for long term storage. |
| The device is easy to store |             Deconstructable design              | The device dismantles into several seperate pieces to make it easier to store. |
| The device is easy to store |             Box shaped housing              | The device has a box shaped outer housing, so it can be stored as is. |
| The device has child-safety features |             Rounded corners              | The device has rounded corners and no jagged edges. |
| The device has child-safety features |             Lock              | The device has a location to place a lock on a control pannel. |
| The device has child-safety features |             Keypad              | The device requires a pin to open/operate. |
| The device has child-safety features |             No small pieces              | The device does not have parts small enough for a child to consume. |
| The device has child-safety features |             Mounting device              | The device has a part that can be used to mount to walls and ceilings, ensuring a child cannot reach or remove the device. |
| The device has a lifetime of at least three months being used consistently |             Brushless motors              | The device will have exclusivly brushless motors to reduce wear. |
| The device has a lifetime of at least three months being used consistently |             Sleep mode              | When not in use the device will go into sleep mode, using only the bare minimum functions to reduce use and wear. |
| The device has a lifetime of at least three months being used consistently |             Wall powered              | The device will not have a battery, so there will be no need to replace batteries. |
