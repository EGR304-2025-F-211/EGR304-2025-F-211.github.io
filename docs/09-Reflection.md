## Lessons Learned
The following are the top 10 most important things that our team learned from working on this project. 

**The most important thing is to always "start early".**

**1. ECAD Experience:**

Many of our group members had not used, or only lightly used, ECAD software before this class. Throughout the class, we discovered how to select the needed components, route connections, and create and assign custom footprints and symbols. Throughout this class, we have gained the skills to use ECAD properly to make a functional PCB. This will likely be helpful in future classes, and possibly in future career paths.

**2. Github Documentation skills:**

Our group learned how to coordinate the use of GitHub to make our documentation for this project. This required us to be able to follow the assignment guidelines to make a legible and organized document, which included adding tables, images, videos, titles, and links. As some of us had not used GitHub in this matter, it was a new skill that we had to learn to complete assignments in this class.

**3. Collaboration:**

Since all of our boards had to be able to communicate with each other, collaboration was an important part of this project. Our group had to ensure that our pins for the ribbon cables matched up and that we were all on the same page when it came to communication protocols between boards. This is a good skill to have learned throughout the project, as no matter what field you end up in, there is likely to be a lot of collaborative efforts between individuals.

**4. Prototyping:**

To ensure that our boards worked before sending in the order for manufacturing, many labs were done throughout this class to allow us to understand how to use the electrical components we were given. This allowed us to be sure that our designs would work before the PCBs were created. Because of this, all of our boards more or less worked right after assembly, with only minor hiccups in the process. Prototyping is a useful skill, and ensures that time, money, and effort are not wasted on a malfunctioning device.

**5. Filtering analog signals with op-amps:**

One of the main requirements for this assignment was amplifying or altering an analog signal in some way to make it a clearer signal for the PSOC to read. This involved connecting the analog signal to an OpAmp in different configurations with different resistor values to get the desired result. Signal processing is a fundamental part of electronic devices, and so is a useful skill to learn.
<br><br>

**6. Design ideation:**

Given a broad goal, our group was tasked with fulfilling a requirement, in this case, "an innovative solution for the home that utilizes simple sensors -- amplified, filtered, and digitized -- to help streamline a process, save resources, or eliminate manual steps". Our team had to be able to take this prompt, create several possible solutions, and eventually settle on a design. This is a skill that ties in with general problem-solving abilities, which is yet another useful skill to develop.

**7. Communication between multiple microcontrollers:**

One requirement of this project was that all 4 of our boards had to be able to communicate with each other. To accomplish this, our group had to decide on what sort of communication protocol we wanted to use and then implement it.
<br><br>

**8. PCB design principles:**

During the PCB design process, we learned about several important aspects of PCB design. Some examples are trace width, decoupling capacitors, annular width, and how to ensure that our designs are aligned with the manufacturing requirements. This knowledge will likely be useful in later classes and is helpful for understanding what exactly goes into the design of a PCB to ensure that it works properly.

**9. Workload allocation:**

Since this assignment was a group project, our group had to develop our skills in allocating different parts of the assignment to each other. Each of us had to make sure we were communicating well with other group members and planning out who would do what and when. As many classes and occupations involve division of labor, this skill is yet another useful one to hone.
<br><br>

**10. Creating Improvements from Feedback:**

Throughout this project, our group was given feedback several times. A large part of this project was taking that feedback and using it to improve and refine our design and documentation. The ability to revise and improve is another useful skill that this project helped to teach.

## Recommendations for future students
The following are our top 5 recommendations for future students taking this class.

**1. Make sure your PCB has correctly sized drill holes:**

Only a few of our PCBs had improperly sized drill holes; fortunately, these were salvageable; however, future students should be completely certain before submitting their designs. Because of time constraints, you will only get one shot at designing the PCB, and any issues made during the design process will come back to haunt you during PCB assembly. Having drill holes that are too small is a surefire way to have a terrible time later.
<br><br>

**2. Focus on the requirements:**

Our group decided to go beyond the standard requirements for the assignment; instead of having just one sensor, most of our boards had 2 sensors or two components. For various reasons, two of our extra components ended up being cut from the boards. Still, it wasn't a negative that our group attempted to get them working, but it's important to focus mainly on the requirements and remember that any extra parts are secondary.
<br><br>

**3. Do well on the GitHub assignments:**

The GitHub documentation assignments in this class are plentiful. There's a lot to do, and the GitHub assignments are actually worth significantly more than actually having a working device pointwise. Because of this, it's very important to make sure you do well on the GitHub assignments. Since the cumulative GitHub document is graded twice throughout the semester, any mistake made in previous sections can affect your grade multiple times.
<br><br>

**4. Be adaptable:**

Throughout the project, plans change, and sometimes you are forced to adjust. To do well, you must be able to reorganise and find new ways to accomplish the assignment. For example, during our project, the Peralta mills stopped working, and we had to quickly make sure our designs were set up properly for production by JLCPB. Additionally, we also changed a large amount of our final design as the assignment went on, starting from a water filtration device and pivoting to an aquaponics setup. Being adaptable is key to success when things change quickly.

**5. Add failsafes to the PCB:**

Make sure that your PCB has lots of failsafes. Extra headers, jumpers, test points, etc. There's only one shot at getting the PCB working, and any sort of backup you design into the board is something you will thank yourself for later. Even if the board becomes a bit more cluttered, it's likely worth it. Our team ran into almost no issues with our PCBs, but we each had several failsafes. If one of our boards did have some sort of issue, it was likely that our backups would have allowed us to still get things working.
