## Lessons Learned

## Recommendations for future students
The following are our top 5 reccomendations for future students taking this class.

1. **Make sure your PCB has correctly sized drill holes:**
Only a few of our PCBs had improperly sized drill holes, fortunately these were salvageable, however future students should be completely certain before submitting their designs. Because of time constraints you will only get one shot at designing the PCB, and any issue made during the design process will come back to haunt you during PCB assembly. Having drill holes that are too small is a surefire way to have a really bad time later.
