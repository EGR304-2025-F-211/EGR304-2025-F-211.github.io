## Lessons Learned
The following are the top 10 most important things that our team learned from working on this project.

1. **ECAD Experience:**
Many of our group members had not used, or only lightly used ECAD software prior to this class. Throughout the class we discovered how to select the needed components, route connections, and create and assign custom footprints and symbols. Throughout this class we have gained the skills to use ECAD properly to make a functional PCB, this will likely be helpful in future classes, and possibly in future career paths.

2. **Github Documentation skills:**
Our group learned how to coordinate the use of github to make our documentation for this project. This required us to be able to follow the assignments guidelines to make a legible and originized document, this included adding tables, images, videos, titles, and links. As some of us had not used github in this matter, it was a new skill that we had to learn to complete assignments in this class.

## Recommendations for future students
The following are our top 5 reccomendations for future students taking this class.

1. **Make sure your PCB has correctly sized drill holes:**
Only a few of our PCBs had improperly sized drill holes, fortunately these were salvageable, however future students should be completely certain before submitting their designs. Because of time constraints you will only get one shot at designing the PCB, and any issue made during the design process will come back to haunt you during PCB assembly. Having drill holes that are too small is a surefire way to have a really bad time later.

2. **Focus on the requirements:**
Our group decided to go beyond the standard requirements for the assignment, instead of having just one sensor, most of our boards had 2 sensors or two components. For various reasons two of our extra components ended up being cut from the boards. Still it wasn't a negative that our group attempted to get them working, but it's important to focus mainly on the requirements and remember that any extra parts are secondary.

3. **Do well on the github assignments:**
The github documentation assignments in this class are plentiful. There's a lot to do and the github assignments are actually worth significantly more than actually having a working device pointswise. Because of this it's very important to make sure you do well on the github assignments, since the cumulative github document is actually graded twice throughout the semester, any mistake made in previous sections have the potential to influence your grade multiple times.
