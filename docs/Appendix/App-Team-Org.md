## Team Goals

List at least five shared goals that reflect a successful product with regard to EGR3X4. Focus on team / product goals that are deeper than "getting an A".
1) A fully functioning product that increases/betters a specific aspect of said product
2) Shared communication throughout the entire project to ensure each team member is aware of the goals and progress
3) Demonstrate understanding of microchip products and software
4) Make sure each team member is pulling their own weight in their respective responsibilities
5) Ask question or attend office hours if all members are lost

### Main Method for Group Communication

Based on the information provided on in the "Team Member Communication Modes," the group primary method of communication is Discord. We have created a group dm to easily send messages images and links. Instructor correspondance will be done by the Assignment leader, or whoever is able via email, and important information with be relayed back to the group dm.
 
## Communication Procedures

1. How will your team communicate?
   Our team will be mainly comminacating using discord on calls or text chat
2. How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group?
   We will keep our instructor up to date either through in person conversations or over email, we will distribute responisbility
   accordingly, all information will need to be fully communicated through discord to ensure everyone is on the same page
