### Main Method for Group Communication

Based on the information provided on in the "Team Member Communication Modes," the group primary method of communication is Discord. We have created a group dm to easily send messages images and links. Instructor correspondance will be done by the Assignment leader, or whoever is able via email, and important information with be relayed back to the group dm.
 
## Communication Procedures

1. How will your team communicate?
2. How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group?
