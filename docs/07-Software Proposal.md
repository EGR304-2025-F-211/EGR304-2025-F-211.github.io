title: Software Proposal
---

## Introduction
**Team 211** is proposing a solution for households' aquaponics systems. With sensors and actuators, the aim is to integrate smart technology into these systems to allow the user a more stress-free and autonomous experience. To allow a system like this to run, the team chose to utilize **_MPLab IDE_** to send code through the **_Microchip PIC Nano_**. The system runs off of a hub and spoke system, so their is a central board that talks to the other 3 boards, which allow a smooth code and purpose for each board.

## Research Question

* Can the team utilize sensors and actuators in the project to obtain...?
* Will using the programming software MPLab sufficient for our teams setup?
* How will the team keep the code working?
