## Team Charter

From the team goals which can be reviewed in ["Appendix: Team Organization"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304TeamTemplate/Appendix/App-Team-Org/), the team's charter formed to be:

> "Team 211 is a group focused on teamwork, communication, and collaboration. We will ensure each team member contributes to team assignments and learns the neccesary skills for said assignments; and we strive to complete our work to the best of our abilities and in a punctual manner." (Team 211's Charter)

This charter was agreed upon because all of our team members value teamwork and effort, and it aligns with our team goals in the "Appendix: Team Orginazation" section. We created this charter to reflect both of those in a short concise paragraph.

## Product Mission Statement

 > "Team 211 product's mission is to competently utilize the materials, tools, and knowledge provided by EGR 304 to help households save water, energy, and time in an innovative way."
