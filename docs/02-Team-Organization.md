## Team Charter

From the team goals, which can be reviewed in ["Appendix: Team Organization"](https://egr304-2025-f-211.github.io/Appendix/App-Team-Org/), the team's charter was formed to be:

> "Team 211 is focused on teamwork, communication, and collaboration. Each team member contributes to team assignments and learns the necessary skills for said assignments, and we strive to complete our work to the best of our abilities and in a punctual manner." (Team 211's Charter)

This charter was agreed upon because all of our team members value teamwork and effort, and it aligns with our team goals in the "Appendix: Team Organization" section. We created this charter to reflect both of those in a short, concise paragraph.

## Product Mission Statement

 > "Team 211 is committed to utilizing the materials, tools, and knowledge provided by EGR 304 to create a device that allows homeowners to better care for their plants, and optimize their water and electricity useage."

This mission statement was agreed upon because it combined the ideals of our charter and team goals, with the design project of this class, to design a device to save water, energy, and time.
