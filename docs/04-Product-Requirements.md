## Introduction
Homeowners across Phoenix strive to minimize their water bills and provide their homes with a high-quality, clean water supply. Arizona tap water is known for its hardness and scarcity, so a system to monitor both water quality and water usage would be a useful device for the average homeowner. Whole-house water supply filters are the only main way to fix this problem. However, we believe with modifying the supply system to make it more intelligent by adding real-time monitoring, an alert system, and water controls, we can help many Arizona homeowners.

## Project Objective

This product aims to design a device capable of saving water, electricity, and time by using simple sensors placed in a home environment. The product created will offer new features that will push our product apart from the existing market of smart home devices. Whether this change is in price, function, or durability. This project aims to create a device that will be effective and efficient in the task it is designed for, and will streamline or improve a pre-existing function of a device/system in a standard home environment, and drive the cost of monthly utility bills down. Some target features we aim to include are sensors that will "read and react" and include a control system.

## Stakeholders

- **Target group**: Residents of the Phoenix area who own homes.
- **Target purchaser**: Target group profile with special attention to homeowners with high water usage or environmental concerns.
- **Customer service**: Prefers easy-to-install, low maitenence, useful device.
- **Marketing & Sales division**: Looks for unique selling points around the user experience and installation process.
- **Retailers**: Prefer smart home-type products with an emphasis on reducing environmental impact.


## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Dan**

Dan is a 67-year-old retired accountant who owns a small home with a lawn and garden. Dan has an automated sprinkler system to provide his plants with plenty of water during the hot Arizona summers. For the sake of his water bill, Dan wants to monitor his water usage, but more importantly, his water quality. Dan wants to make sure both he and his plants have healthy, clean water to drink.

Because of this, Dan purchased our water monitoring system and can rest assured that both he and his plants are receiving high-quality water. Dan can also use the device to monitor his water usage to determine how best to care for his garden.

**User Story #2: Erin**

Erin is a 42-year-old who owns a home in the Phoenix area. During the summer, Erin does her best to limit her water usage to keep her water bill low. Despite her best attempts, it's difficult for Erin to get a gauge on just how much water she is using, and if her attempts to limit her usage are doing much at all. Because of this, Erin installs a water monitoring system to get a better idea of the data.

Using this system, Erin can find out just how much water she is saving, and is thankful for the clarity that the system provides.
