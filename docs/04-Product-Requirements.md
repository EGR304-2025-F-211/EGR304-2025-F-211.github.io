## Project Objective

(This project aims to investigate and develop smart adaptive technologies, an improved user experience, better fit, improved product design, and product customization options for the next-generation AirPods. The target is to maintain global dominance in the wireless earphone market, drive up AirPod sales to 100 million+ units sold with a 60% global market share in 2021 and expand the user base more towards the luxury, professional, and fitness segments. We believe that adding smart interactions and adaptive audio filters alone will already expand our user base by 15%. With the new generation AirPods we aim to match at least the sound quality of our main competitor, the Sony WF-1000XM3, and include Active Noise Canceling that is also featured in Mifo, House of Marley, Bose, and Amazon Echo products. We will also obtain IPX4 sweat-resistant rating equal to Bose, House of Marley, and Amazon Echo earbuds, and aim to extend our range of colors, as seen in Urbanista and Jabra’s lifestyle products.) <--- I'm keeping this here for now so it can be a reference for what the project objective is meant to look like 👍

This product aims to design a device capable of saving water, electricity, or time, by using simple sensors placed in a home environment. The product we create will offer something new to put it above the existing market of smart home devices, whether in price, function, or durability. The device this project aims to create will be effective and efficient in the task it is designed for, and will streamline or improve a pre-existing function of a device/system in a standard home environment.

## Stakeholders

## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Jenna**
Jenna is a 33-year-old executive who regularly visits a bar for lunch to blow off some steam. The bar is often loud with people, but it is paramount that she can hold business conversations over the phone there. Then again, she does not want to miss out on the atmosphere and be able to hear the waiters as well. Her new Apple wireless earphones allow her to switch instantly between a mode where she can fully focus on the phone conversation and a mode where the phone call and environmental sound are seamlessly combined. They also allow her to rapidly adjust the volume on the earbuds themselves without having to take out her phone.

Jenna occasionally visits the bar in the evenings. She is a big fan of the L.A. Lakers, and whenever they play, she streams the live footage through her phone. Her new earbuds allow her to easily switch to hearing everything around her and streaming the match commentary without having to ever take the earbuds out.  She sometimes gets compliments on how stylish the earbuds look on her, and she wouldn’t want to miss out on hearing those either.
