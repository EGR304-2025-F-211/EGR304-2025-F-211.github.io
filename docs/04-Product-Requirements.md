## Introduction
Plant owners across Phoenix want to keep their plants happy and healthy, but sometimes it can be difficult to monitor your plants with your hectic life. We plan to make a device that can monitor indoor houseplants, hands free and automatically. We believe this type of device could help save time, effort, and water, as well as alleviating a repetitive task from the plant owner, and ensuring that their plants remain healthy and watered with minimal effort.

## Project Objective

This product aims to design a device capable of saving water, electricity, and time by using simple sensors placed in a home environment. The product created will offer new features that will push our product apart from the existing market of smart home devices. Whether this change is in price, function, or durability. This project aims to create a device that will be effective and efficient in the task it is designed for, and will streamline or improve a pre-existing function of a device/system in a standard home environment, and drive the cost of monthly utility bills down. Some target features we aim to include are sensors that will "read and react" and include a control system.

## Stakeholders

- **Target group**: Residents of the Phoenix area who own plants.
- **Target purchaser**: Target group profile with special attention to indoor gardeners.
- **Customer service**: Prefers easy-to-install, low maitenence, useful device.
- **Marketing & Sales division**: Looks for unique selling points around the user experience and installation process.
- **Retailers**: Prefer smart home-type products with an aquaponics.


## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Dan**

Dan is a 67-year-old retired accountant who owns a small home with a lawn, garden, and a handfull of indoor houseplants. During his busy life Dan sometimes forgets whether or not he has watered his indoor plants, leading to over or under watering, causing his plants to wither. Dan purchases and installs an automated system to monitor his indoor plants for him, and is relieved that his indoor plants begin to flourish once again.

This sytem allows Dan to attend to other objectives in his day to day life, with the peace of mind knowing his plants are cared for.

**User Story #2: Erin**

Erin is a 42-year-old who owns a potted plant in the Phoenix area. The particular plant Erin owns requires a consistantly moist environment, which is difficult to maintain in the dry summer heat. Additionally Erin often has to leave the house for long periods of time, leaving the plant. Erin installs a plant monitoring system to keep her plant watered while she out and about, and no longer has to worry about getting home in time to water in consistantly.

Using this system, Erin can keep her plant healthy and watered, with much less constant maintainence, only checking in every so often to refill the tank.
