## Introduction
Homeowners across Phoenix strive to minimize their water bills, and provide their house with a high quality, clean, water supply. Arizona tap water is known for its hardness, and scarcity, so a system to monitor both water quality and water usage would be a useful device for the average homeowner.

## Project Objective

This product aims to design a device capable of saving water, electricity, and time by using simple sensors placed in a home environment. The product created will offer new features that will push our product apart from the existing market of smart home devices. Whether this change is in price, function, or durability. This project aims to create a device that will be effective and efficient in the task it is designed for, and will streamline or improve a pre-existing function of a device/system in a standard home environment, and drive the cost of monthly utility bills down. Some target features we aim to include are sensors that will "read and react", a shutoff system, and a controller for a user interface. (Please change if needed)

## Stakeholders

- **Target group** Residents of the Phoenix area who own homes.
- **Target purchaser** Target group profile with special attention to homeowners with high water usage or environmental concerns.
- **Customer service** Prefers easy-to-install, low maitenence, useful device.
- **Marketing & Sales division** Looks for unique selling points around the user experience and installation process.
- **Retailers** Prefer smart home type products with an emphasis in reducing environmental impact.


## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Dan**
Dan is a 67-year-old retired accountant who owns a small home with a lawn and garden. Dan has an automated sprinkler system to provide his plants with plenty of water during the hot Arizona summers, but he worries that with all the water systems he has, one of them is bound to spring a leak eventually. Knowing this, Dan purchases a water monitoring device to ensure that he will be aware of any possible leaks before they get out of control.

With his new water monitoring system Dan can leave the house with peace of mind and the confidence that he will not be returning to find his garden flooded. Dan has already been alerted of a small leak, and discovered a pair of faulty sprinkler heads. Knowing that the system detected this leak gives him confidence that in the case of disaster, his plants and water bill will remain safe and protected.

**User Story #2: Erin**
Erin is a 42-year-old who owns a home in the pheonix area. During the summers Erin does her best to limit her water usage to keep her water bill low. Despite her best attempts it's difficult for Erin to get a gauge on just how much water she is using, and if her attempts to limit her usage are doing much at all. Because of this Erin installs a water monitoring system to get a better idea of the data.

Using this system Erin can find out just how much water she is saving, and is thankful for the clarity that the system provides.
