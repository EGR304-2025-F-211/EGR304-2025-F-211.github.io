## Team Introduction
Team 211 is a 4-person team consisting of Levi, Hafsa, Kelton, and Michael. Each students in the class EGR 304 under professor Kevin Nichols at Arizona State University. The team is working on an **_Automated Plant Irrigation System_** that utilizes sensors and actuators. This project allows for a more autonomous garden system and also allows for maximum plant care.
