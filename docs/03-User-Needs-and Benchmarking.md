| We bought this switch to replace the mechanical one in the garage, since we were all too often leaving it on all day after driving out. This switch was easy to wire, looks good for a motion sensor, and more importantly, it just works every time. Now we never need to think about lighting when leaving or coming home; the garage is always well-lit when we need it to be. | 1. The device is easy to set up, reliable, and "looks good" (explicit) |
| Very effective. Easy to install | 2. Device is effective and easy to install (explicit) |
| Easy to install and allow the lights to come on without hands by just entering the room. Goes off quickly after motion has ended. Fits any single conventional light switch so it can be used for both 1/4 and 1/2 bathrooms perfectly. | 3. Does it's job well and integrates well into the home (explicit) |

| Installation instructions are not included with the package. What you do get is a QR code, where you are required to log in to the Lutron web site to find them. So if there is no Internet access where you are doing the installation, you are SOL. Plus reading them on an iPhone or equivalent, and having to navigate from page to page on a tiny device while juggling your tools isn't ideal. All this aggravation for the buyer to save the negligible cost of including paper instructions in the package. Really? | 1. Customer wants physical instructions (explicit) |
| If you’re not going to include the faceplate take the pic off the sale listing. Noone appreciates being tricked bc if I’d known I’d have gone with another brand. | 2. Non-deceptive advertisement (explicit) |
| I ordered this product on January 12th 2025 for our laundry room. It went out yesterday and I had to put a regular 3 way switch back. It lasted about 5 months and it was great when it worked. | 3. Long product lifetime (implicit) |

| Both freezers are now monitored 24/7 after freezer door left open and I lost lots of $$. Alarms are configured for temperature outside of range that you set. I can see temps on my iPhone when I’m not home. Best item I have purchased in a long time. So easy to setup that this senior had no issues. Love love love! | 1. Easy setup (explicit) Financially beneficial (implicit) |
| It is very handy to have the readings sent to the app. This thermometer gives you the peace of mind that your food won't be thawing. Easy to use/understand the functions on the app. You can set your own temp alarms to alert you when you feel the temp would be too warm. You can set a time frame to get the alert in case you are in and out of the freezer a lot on a given day. It gives you readings of past hours, weeks, months. Happy with the purchase. | 2. Peace of mind (explicit) |
| If you're renting this is a must have for if or when your landlord special apartment doesn't want to acknowledge issues. Great to have if your fridge is having issues to be able to show maintenance time stamps of when the issues start. Anytime we've run into a hiccup with any Govee product their customer service is amazing. | 3. Good customer service (explicit) |

| Returned. Was too complicated for this old lady to use them. I am not very tech savvy. Maybe good for younger folks. | 1. Simple to use (explicit)|
| The wire does not conform to my freezer seal. Our alarm kept going off leading us to think there was a problem with our freezer. We paid Frigidaire $350 for a guaranteed fix and the technician proved the wire was breaking the seal enough where warm air was getting in and causing the temperature to spike. He moved the monitor and our problem was solved. Ironic that the issue this alarm caused me was more expensive than the problem I was trying to prevent. | 2. Functionality (Explicit) |
| This Govee wifi connected refrigerator thermometer is highly inaccurate. Alarm kept going off all the time. I purchase a good old fashioned thermometer with a dial and it was way more accurate. Terrible purchase! | 3. Reliability (explicit) |

| We have had numerous leaks in our home. It’s all part of homeownership but these give us a little peace of mind. Very easy to set up. Literally put batteries in, set them in areas you may experience a leak. The app works great too. If it detects water, the device itself alarms (loudly) and the app alerts you too! Nice to have if you’re not home. It comes with a “home” unit that simply plugs into a standard outlet and receives the signal from the individual sensors. I placed one under the kitchen sink, near the water heater, and under a bathroom sink. They are a good value for the money and have a slick design. | Peace of mind (explicit) |
| Honestly this was super easy to setup and is amazingly accurate! I dropped a couple of drips on it and it immediately worked and sent alerts to my phone, email and did the audible tone. It connected easily to the WiFi and is super durable. This is a great product!!! | Ease of use (explicit) |
| It works- I was leaving to run some errands and the alarms went off on my phone, I really thought it must be a false alarm- sweat from the pipes or something but I went back home and it was a real flood- pipe leak flooding the basement, the alarms on the units were going off - I would recommend these alarms. | Reliability (implicit) |

| Buyer beware! I bought two of these based on the reviews I read on Amazon. When I received them, it was impossible to connect them to my Wi-Fi network, and continue to be impossible, even though I researched it online. To add insult to injury, when I set up the return, I noticed they did not refund the entire amount, but charged me $20 for shipping. Disgraceful and the seller should refund the entire amount or Amazon should refund it. I won’t be duped again. | Good customer service (explicit) |
| I got all the connections set up and confirmed all devices were connected only to determine that this water detector does NOT detect water. Any device like this I need to be reliable 100% of the time, 0% doesn't cut it, Would not recommend. | Reliability (explicit) |
| I never got around to installing or testing the actual sensor. The gateway emits a high-pitched noise when the blue light is on (always once connected to wi-fi) that was unbearable (turn up the volume on the video, it's subtle, but very annoying). This may be ok for some people if the gateway is in a room that isn't accessed often, but my gateway would have been in an area that we spend at leased some time exercising in. I ordered the H5058's instead and they seem to work fine. | Product should be non-obtrusive |

| This product feels well designed and made. The installation takes some effort and patience to fit all the sensors in the electrical panel. One certainly want to make sure clearly label everything. Once installed, it works fairly well. The software is pretty easy to use and the usage numbers are pretty close to my power bill. I really like its integration with Home Assistant. | Accuracy and ease of use (explicit) |
| Only been using this smart home energy monitor for a few weeks and it seems to be working well so far. It is nice to be able to see the energy consumption for your home. Installation seemed to be straightforward, and anything I had trouble figuring out was answered in the installation manual. However, after installation and looking at the readings on my app, they seemed to be showing up with negative values, indicating that the circuit sensors were installed backwards. Luckily, I found out that you can adjust the circuit factors to -1 to reverse the reading to show positive consumption. Also, during the installation, I tried to pull out the Wi-Fi antenna from the module after unscrewing it and it broke off. The construction of the antenna seems to be very fragile. It would be nice if this was constructed with more durability to prevent this. I ended up purchasing a replacement antenna and it worked. | Durability (explicit) |
| Works great! I bought it so that I could monitor my home's power usage via Home Assistant and I'm getting all the data that I need. Installation was a breeze (just please be very careful and, if you are uncomfortable working with live power, turn off your home's breaker). | Easue of installation (explicit) |

| The app for this product is garbage. It has little to no functionailty. It is hard to name your channels as the appliances/circuits you are monitoring. You are unable to combine 240 V devices on two different phases into a combined output. The circuit multiplier screen on the app is very glichy, and doesn't work. When you want to output the data to a spreadsheet it doesn't carry over the names of your circuits, but just A1, B1, C1 as generic descriptions. Because of how the device is designed you can only monitor 5 devices on one phase of your panel, and then the remaining 11 channels have to monitor only devices on the remaining phase. For example if you have 7 devices on the A phase you want to monitor, and 6 devices on theB phase you have to pick the top circuits because you have to choose 5 on one and 11 on the other. Therefore you can't choose the top 16 devices you want to monitor. | Good user interface (explicit) |
| Even after double checking and triple checking, values are either wrong or reversed | Reliability (explicit)|
|Once installed the monitor did a good job at what it says it will do. Initially, I was going to install this in our house however, there simply was not enough room in our electrical panel for that to happen so I opted to install it at my parent's house as they have more room in their panel.
As other reviews have stated the direction in which the clamps need to be facing is incorrect according the manual and arrows on the clamps themselves, but this is a simple fix. The manual could be improved a bit as needed to do a bit of research to determine exactly which instructions to follow.
It would be nice if they app could have an overview with charts for overall circuit usage. Where you can see how much each circuit is contributing to the overall power usage, but maybe this will come with time.
Overall, it works and does what it says it will. I was able to successfully install it, however, I can easily see how it might be too complicated for others, and so professional installation might be needed by an electrician.| Clear instructions (explicit) |
