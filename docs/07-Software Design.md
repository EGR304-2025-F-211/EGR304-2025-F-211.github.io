## Introduction
**Team 211** is proposing a solution for households' aquaponics systems. With sensors and actuators, the aim is to integrate smart technology into these systems to allow the user a more stress-free and autonomous experience. To allow a system like this to run, the team chose to utilize **_MPLab IDE_** to send code through the **_Microchip PIC Nano_**. The system runs off of a hub and spoke system, so their is a central board that talks to the other 3 boards, which allow a smooth code and purpose for each board. 

## Research Questions
* Will the code be intuitive enough for any user to utilize the features? 
* Will using the programming software MPLab be sufficient for our team's setup?
* How will the code handle all the functions, and for how long?
