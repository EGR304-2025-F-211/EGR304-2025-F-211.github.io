We paid Frigidaire $350 for a guaranteed fix and the technician proved the wire was breaking the seal enough where warm air was getting in and causing the temperature to spike.

If it detects water, the device itself alarms (loudly) and the app alerts you too! Nice to have if you\u2019re not home. It comes with a \u201chome\u201d unit that simply plugs into a standard outlet and receives the signal from the individual sensors. I placed one under the kitchen sink, near the water heater, and under a bathroom sink. They are a good value for the money and have a slick design.

Ease of use (explicit) It works- I was leaving to run some errands and the alarms went off on my phone, I really thought it must be a false alarm- sweat from the pipes or something but I went back home and it was a real flood- pipe leak flooding the basement, the alarms on the units were going off - I would recommend these alarms.

I bought two of these based on the reviews I read on Amazon. When I received them, it was impossible to connect them to my Wi-Fi network, and continue to be impossible, even though I researched it online. To add insult to injury, when I set up the return, I noticed they did not refund the entire amount, but charged me $20 for shipping. Disgraceful and the seller should refund the entire amount or Amazon should refund it. I won\u2019t be duped again. Good customer service (explicit) I got all the connections set up and confirmed all devices were connected only to determine that this water detector does NOT detect water. Any device like this I need to be reliable 100% of the time, 0% doesn't cut it, Would not recommend. Reliability (explicit) I never got around to installing or testing the actual sensor. The gateway emits a high-pitched noise when the blue light is on (always once connected to wi-fi) that was unbearable (turn up the volume on the video, it's subtle, but very annoying). This may be ok for some people if the gateway is in a room that isn't accessed often, but my gateway would have been in an area that we spend at leased some time exercising in.

The installation takes some effort and patience to fit all the sensors in the electrical panel. One certainly want to make sure clearly label everything. Once installed, it works fairly well. The software is pretty easy to use and the usage numbers are pretty close to my power bill. I really like its integration with Home Assistant. Accuracy and ease of use (explicit) Only been using this smart home energy monitor for a few weeks and it seems to be working well so far. It is nice to be able to see the energy consumption for your home. Installation seemed to be straightforward, and anything I had trouble figuring out was answered in the installation manual. However, after installation and looking at the readings on my app, they seemed to be showing up with negative values, indicating that the circuit sensors were installed backwards. Luckily, I found out that you can adjust the circuit factors to -1 to reverse the reading to show positive consumption. Also, during the installation, I tried to pull out the Wi-Fi antenna from the module after unscrewing it and it broke off. The construction of the antenna seems to be very fragile. It would be nice if this was constructed with more durability to prevent this. I ended up purchasing a replacement antenna and it worked. Durability (explicit) Works great! I bought it so that I could monitor my home's power usage via Home Assistant and I'm getting all the data that I need. Installation was a breeze (just please be very careful and, if you are uncomfortable working with live power, turn off your home's breaker).

It has little to no functionailty. It is hard to name your channels as the appliances/circuits you are monitoring. You are unable to combine 240 V devices on two different phases into a combined output. The circuit multiplier screen on the app is very glichy, and doesn't work. When you want to output the data to a spreadsheet it doesn't carry over the names of your circuits, but just A1, B1, C1 as generic descriptions. Because of how the device is designed you can only monitor 5 devices on one phase of your panel, and then the remaining 11 channels have to monitor only devices on the remaining phase. For example if you have 7 devices on the A phase you want to monitor, and 6 devices on theB phase you have to pick the top circuits because you have to choose 5 on one and 11 on the other. Therefore you can't choose the top 16 devices you want to monitor. Good user interface (explicit) Even after double checking and triple checking, values are either wrong or reversed Reliability (explicit) Once installed the monitor did a good job at what it says it will do. Initially, I was going to install this in our house however, there simply was not enough room in our electrical panel for that to happen so I opted to install it at my parent's house as they have more room in their panel. As other reviews have stated the direction in which the clamps need to be facing is incorrect according the manual and arrows on the clamps themselves, but this is a simple fix. The manual could be improved a bit as needed to do a bit of research to determine exactly which instructions to follow. It would be nice if they app could have an overview with charts for overall circuit usage. Where you can see how much each circuit is contributing to the overall power usage, but maybe this will come with time. Overall, it works and does what it says it will. I was able to successfully install it, however, I can easily see how it might be too complicated for others, and so professional installation might be needed by an electrician.

It gives me peace of mind knowing that if there is ever a leak, it will automatically shut the water off before any damage happens. The app makes it simple to check water usage and I get instant notifications if something unusual is going on. The unit itself feels sturdy and well built, so I know it will last. Installation took a little effort, but once it was in place everything worked perfectly. The app is easy to use and makes managing alerts straightforward. Overall this has been a great purchase and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants extra protection for their home and an easy way to monitor water use. Ease of use and robustness (explicit) The installation was straightforward if you know basic plumbing, sizing, etc. the app setup was a breeze and I am hoping this saves me from any more water damage. My whole downstairs flooded and I bought this to help prevent that from happening again. I love that it gives you PSI counts, the GPM counts, and also the temperature of the water. It is currently still \u201clearning\u201d my habits for our family and I hope it works as good as it says. This links right up to my ring dashboard as well for easy on and off. I added an image to show that I installed it right after my main shut off valve in case I need to do any warranty claims for it. I also recommend doing the $5 a month for 5 year warranty on the device. Peace of mind (latent) I had this installed five years ago, and it truly saved us while we were on vacation. We were on a 7-day cruise when a pipe burst upstairs at 3:37 AM, causing water to pour out from the bathroom. Thankfully, the system detected the issue, shut off the water to the entire house, and immediately alerted us\u2014first by text, then with a phone call. This gave us a chance to check whether it was a false alarm. I quickly pulled up our hallway camera and saw water gushing from the bathroom, flooding our wood floors. But thanks to the Flo, the damage was limited. Just imagine if water had been running like that for the entire week\u2014we would\u2019ve come home to a disaster. I can\u2019t tell you how relieved I was. I recommend this to everyone. Funny enough, I told all my family and close friends, but not one of them ended up installing it. Oh well. Just a heads-up\u2014this unit can be installed outdoors, but I protected mine with an enclosure to shield it from the Florida sun and rain. Hopefully, that gives you an idea for how to protect yours too. Reliability (explicit)","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-User-Needs-and%20Benchmarking/#negative-comments_4","title":"NEGATIVE COMMENTS","text":"Voice of the customer Restated Customer need On the surface, the Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff Valve seems like a great idea \u2014 a device that prevents water damage by monitoring for leaks. However, after using it for over a year (forced by my insurance company), I\u2019ve realized it's a crude product with a simplistic design and a surprisingly unintelligent software system. The device frequently generates false alarms, causing more inconvenience than protection. For example, my wife and daughter were taking showers after returning from Japan, and the device decided that was \u201cabnormal\u201d usage and shut off our entire home\u2019s water. Another time, I was woken up at 3 AM because it thought our regular sprinkler system was unusual activity. And during visits from guests, the water was abruptly turned off. Worse yet, the system gives the user no meaningful control or customization. Only the user truly understands what\u2019s normal for their household. Water use varies daily, but this device forces rigid, one-size-fits-all rules that often don\u2019t reflect reality. To make matters worse, the device requires constant power and internet access, which are not always available where your main water line enters the home. Meeting these requirements can be very costly, especially if electrical outlets or Wi-Fi coverage need to be extended or upgraded just for this device. In summary, this device is frustrating, intrusive, expensive to install, and poorly thought out. It doesn't make your home smarter \u2014 it just makes daily life more complicated. 1. Reliability and affordable price (explicit) I bought the Flo device in 2021, at that time it made a lot of sense to have something that would watch over water flow, catch leaks and drips, and notify me. The installation, by a professional plumber, cost more than the price of the device itself, but I wanted it done right, considering it was going to control the main water supply to our home. It worked well for a couple of years, then started malfunctioning (such as leak alarms when there were none, etc). We were away from home for some time and chose to turn the valve off but left the device on. On return, it would not open when signaled on the app. Tech Support was not able to operate the valve remotely either. They asked me to me to open it manually, which I did. If I wanted continued monitoring, Tech Support advised me to buy a new device as well as an extended warrantee. I decided to live with it, because at that time, the flow monitoring part was working fine, and in case there was a problem, I would still get the alert, just not able to shut it off remotely. The other day, I started getting alerts that the device was off line. Upon checking I could see that it had power, but the power connector was filled with water, and the box itself was quite warm. I pulled off the power supply, dried the connector and plugged it back in. The device was totally dead. This was disappointing. I dont expect a mission-critical device, which controls water flow into the house, to die in 3 years. I would not recommend it, because it is not reliable, and after spending over 1.4K for the device and install, I don't expect it to fail so soon. 2. Reliability and longevity (explicit) Another good reason why this product has such a low rating: You must read their documents, you are giving away too many rights! It is a binding contract! This product is controlling the water supply to your home! The only way you can read the terms and conditions to use the app and connected products is to download the Moen Flo-Smart Water Monitor app on your phone, go through some procedures, and then good luck trying to read the tiny print of the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for the Moen Mobile Applications and Connected Products on your phone. I called Moen to request a link (can\u2019t find it online) so I can read it on my computer. I also printed it up, 13 pages of double-space 12 font text. Some examples: Section 6 (i): \u201cYou are giving Moen and its designees perpetual, irrevocable\u2026..right to exploit the User Content and any person\u2019s property (physical, personal, and indicia) contained therein\u2026\u2026without any payment or other consideration of any kind\u2026..\u201d Section 9.

I wasted a lot of my time researching the product, wasted a plumber\u2019s time to come out and tell me how much to install it, packing it up to send it back, and gave up reading the rest of this nonsense. There has to be a better product out there. 3.

The main hub, designed by Kelton, will provide shared power from a wall-mounted power supply and communication between the boards using 8-pin connectors while also displaying information through an LCD screen with a rotary encoder for user input and screen selection. To detect any failures in the irrigation system or to alert the user that the water storage tank connected to the device is running low, Hafsa's subsystem is designed to read, translate, and send information from a pressure sensor connected to the tubing and an IR sensor mounted inside the tank to Kelton's board. Levi's board uses a photoresistor to detect whether or not the plant is getting enough sunlight, and sends that data to Kelton's board. Michael's subsystem recieves information from Kelton's board about the other sensors based on their state and activates or deactivates a solenoid valve in the tubing if the plant soil is too dry and a speaker alarm if there are failures in the system.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1: Team Block Diagram and Connections.

With sensors and actuators, the aim is to integrate smart technology into these systems to allow the user a more stress-free and autonomous experience. To allow a system like this to run, the team chose to utilize MPLab IDE to send code through the Microchip PIC Nano. The system runs off of a hub and spoke system, so their is a central board that talks to the other 3 boards, which allow a smooth code and purpose for each board. </p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/#research-questions","title":"Research Questions","text":"<ul> <li>Will the code be intuitive enough for any user to utilize the features? </li> <li>Will using the programming software MPLab be sufficient for our team's setup?</li> <li>How will the code handle all the functions, and for how long?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/#software-diagram","title":"Software Diagram","text":"<p> Figure 1: Program Process   | PDF Download  | Draw.io Download |</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/#software-design-v2","title":"Software design V2","text":"<p>Our software functioned fine for the project, it did everything it was meant to do fairly quickly with no major errors. However there are still a few possible improvements that could be made. One possible improvement is the use of interrupts, in our current code each step happens in a linear order, meaning we are limited by every delay in every step. With interrupts we could run the user input logic loop, and have interrupts set up for reading measurement data from the other boards. This could allow us to display measurement data faster as the code would not have to wait through each step.</p> <p>Additionally we could offload some of the work to the other boards. Instead of having each of the measurement boards send their raw analog values, the boards could instead convert those values to a more meaningful 0-100% scale, this would remove the work from the main board and ensure we are only sending understandable values. Another benefit of this would be less work for the main board, during our testing the main hub board got concerningly hot, and this may have been in part due to the large amount of code running on it compared to the other boards.</p> <p>Another small change we could have made to the code is allowing the alarm board to play more complex sounds. Currently the alarm board is only set up to play a single note via a square wave, but it has the capability to play more complex sounds. In a hypothetical V2 software design, we could add the ability to play small melodies or have spoken prompts to convey more information to the user.</p>"},{"location":"08-Resources/","title":"08 Resources","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/#resources","title":"Resources","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/#team-member-board-pictures","title":"Team member board pictures:","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/#levis-board-sunlight-detector","title":"Levi's board (Sunlight detector)","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/#michaels-board-alarm-system","title":"Michael's board (Alarm system)","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/#hafsas-board-pressure-and-water-level-monitor","title":"Hafsa's board (Pressure and water level monitor)","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/#keltons-board-communication-hub-user-input","title":"Kelton's board (communication hub / user input)","text":""},{"location":"08-Resources/#complete-setup-picture","title":"Complete setup picture:","text":""},{"location":"09-Reflection/","title":"09 Reflection","text":""},{"location":"09-Reflection/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/","title":"Appendix - Main Page","text":"<p>The Appendix is where supporting information goes that is not in the main body.</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/","title":"Appendix: Team Organization","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#team-goals","title":"Team Goals","text":"<ol> <li>Produce a fully functioning product that increases/betters a specific aspect of said product</li> <li>Engage in shared communication throughout the entire project to ensure each team member is aware of the goals and progress</li> <li>Create a design that demonstrates understanding of microchip products and software</li> <li>Ensure team members are fufilling their respective responsibilities and assist each other when able </li> <li>Do further research, ask questions, and/or attend office hours if members are lost </li> </ol>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#communication-channels","title":"Communication Channels","text":"<p>Appendix Table 1: Team Member Communication Modes</p> Name First Choice Communication Second Choice Communication Third Choice Communication Levi Addink Discord Text Email Kelton Jensen Discord Text Email Hafsa Kaysan Discord Email Text Michael Kim Discord Email Text","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#main-method-for-group-communication","title":"Main Method for Group Communication","text":"<p>Based on the information provided on in the Team Member Communication Modes, the group primary method of communication is Discord.
