I bought two of these based on the reviews I read on Amazon.

To add insult to injury, when I set up the return, I noticed they did not refund the entire amount, but charged me $20 for shipping. Disgraceful and the seller should refund the entire amount or Amazon should refund it. I won\u2019t be duped again. Good customer service (explicit) I got all the connections set up and confirmed all devices were connected only to determine that this water detector does NOT detect water. Any device like this I need to be reliable 100% of the time, 0% doesn't cut it, Would not recommend. Reliability (explicit) I never got around to installing or testing the actual sensor. The gateway emits a high-pitched noise when the blue light is on (always once connected to wi-fi) that was unbearable (turn up the volume on the video, it's subtle, but very annoying). This may be ok for some people if the gateway is in a room that isn't accessed often, but my gateway would have been in an area that we spend at leased some time exercising in.

The software is pretty easy to use and the usage numbers are pretty close to my power bill. I really like its integration with Home Assistant. Accuracy and ease of use (explicit) Only been using this smart home energy monitor for a few weeks and it seems to be working well so far. It is nice to be able to see the energy consumption for your home. Installation seemed to be straightforward, and anything I had trouble figuring out was answered in the installation manual. However, after installation and looking at the readings on my app, they seemed to be showing up with negative values, indicating that the circuit sensors were installed backwards. Luckily, I found out that you can adjust the circuit factors to -1 to reverse the reading to show positive consumption. Also, during the installation, I tried to pull out the Wi-Fi antenna from the module after unscrewing it and it broke off. The construction of the antenna seems to be very fragile. It would be nice if this was constructed with more durability to prevent this. I ended up purchasing a replacement antenna and it worked. Durability (explicit) Works great! I bought it so that I could monitor my home's power usage via Home Assistant and I'm getting all the data that I need.

It has little to no functionailty. It is hard to name your channels as the appliances/circuits you are monitoring. You are unable to combine 240 V devices on two different phases into a combined output. The circuit multiplier screen on the app is very glichy, and doesn't work. When you want to output the data to a spreadsheet it doesn't carry over the names of your circuits, but just A1, B1, C1 as generic descriptions. Because of how the device is designed you can only monitor 5 devices on one phase of your panel, and then the remaining 11 channels have to monitor only devices on the remaining phase. For example if you have 7 devices on the A phase you want to monitor, and 6 devices on theB phase you have to pick the top circuits because you have to choose 5 on one and 11 on the other. Therefore you can't choose the top 16 devices you want to monitor. Good user interface (explicit) Even after double checking and triple checking, values are either wrong or reversed Reliability (explicit) Once installed the monitor did a good job at what it says it will do. Initially, I was going to install this in our house however, there simply was not enough room in our electrical panel for that to happen so I opted to install it at my parent's house as they have more room in their panel. As other reviews have stated the direction in which the clamps need to be facing is incorrect according the manual and arrows on the clamps themselves, but this is a simple fix. The manual could be improved a bit as needed to do a bit of research to determine exactly which instructions to follow. It would be nice if they app could have an overview with charts for overall circuit usage. Where you can see how much each circuit is contributing to the overall power usage, but maybe this will come with time. Overall, it works and does what it says it will. I was able to successfully install it, however, I can easily see how it might be too complicated for others, and so professional installation might be needed by an electrician.

The app makes it simple to check water usage and I get instant notifications if something unusual is going on. The unit itself feels sturdy and well built, so I know it will last. Installation took a little effort, but once it was in place everything worked perfectly. The app is easy to use and makes managing alerts straightforward. Overall this has been a great purchase and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants extra protection for their home and an easy way to monitor water use. Ease of use and robustness (explicit) The installation was straightforward if you know basic plumbing, sizing, etc. the app setup was a breeze and I am hoping this saves me from any more water damage. My whole downstairs flooded and I bought this to help prevent that from happening again. I love that it gives you PSI counts, the GPM counts, and also the temperature of the water.

I added an image to show that I installed it right after my main shut off valve in case I need to do any warranty claims for it. I also recommend doing the $5 a month for 5 year warranty on the device. Peace of mind (latent) I had this installed five years ago, and it truly saved us while we were on vacation. We were on a 7-day cruise when a pipe burst upstairs at 3:37 AM, causing water to pour out from the bathroom. Thankfully, the system detected the issue, shut off the water to the entire house, and immediately alerted us\u2014first by text, then with a phone call. This gave us a chance to check whether it was a false alarm. I quickly pulled up our hallway camera and saw water gushing from the bathroom, flooding our wood floors. But thanks to the Flo, the damage was limited. Just imagine if water had been running like that for the entire week\u2014we would\u2019ve come home to a disaster. I can\u2019t tell you how relieved I was. I recommend this to everyone. Funny enough, I told all my family and close friends, but not one of them ended up installing it. Oh well. Just a heads-up\u2014this unit can be installed outdoors, but I protected mine with an enclosure to shield it from the Florida sun and rain.

However, after using it for over a year (forced by my insurance company), I\u2019ve realized it's a crude product with a simplistic design and a surprisingly unintelligent software system. The device frequently generates false alarms, causing more inconvenience than protection. For example, my wife and daughter were taking showers after returning from Japan, and the device decided that was \u201cabnormal\u201d usage and shut off our entire home\u2019s water. Another time, I was woken up at 3 AM because it thought our regular sprinkler system was unusual activity. And during visits from guests, the water was abruptly turned off. Worse yet, the system gives the user no meaningful control or customization. Only the user truly understands what\u2019s normal for their household. Water use varies daily, but this device forces rigid, one-size-fits-all rules that often don\u2019t reflect reality. To make matters worse, the device requires constant power and internet access, which are not always available where your main water line enters the home. Meeting these requirements can be very costly, especially if electrical outlets or Wi-Fi coverage need to be extended or upgraded just for this device. In summary, this device is frustrating, intrusive, expensive to install, and poorly thought out. It doesn't make your home smarter \u2014 it just makes daily life more complicated. 1. Reliability and affordable price (explicit) I bought the Flo device in 2021, at that time it made a lot of sense to have something that would watch over water flow, catch leaks and drips, and notify me. The installation, by a professional plumber, cost more than the price of the device itself, but I wanted it done right, considering it was going to control the main water supply to our home. It worked well for a couple of years, then started malfunctioning (such as leak alarms when there were none, etc). We were away from home for some time and chose to turn the valve off but left the device on. On return, it would not open when signaled on the app. Tech Support was not able to operate the valve remotely either. They asked me to me to open it manually, which I did. If I wanted continued monitoring, Tech Support advised me to buy a new device as well as an extended warrantee. I decided to live with it, because at that time, the flow monitoring part was working fine, and in case there was a problem, I would still get the alert, just not able to shut it off remotely. The other day, I started getting alerts that the device was off line. Upon checking I could see that it had power, but the power connector was filled with water, and the box itself was quite warm. I pulled off the power supply, dried the connector and plugged it back in. The device was totally dead. This was disappointing. I dont expect a mission-critical device, which controls water flow into the house, to die in 3 years. I would not recommend it, because it is not reliable, and after spending over 1.4K for the device and install, I don't expect it to fail so soon. 2. Reliability and longevity (explicit) Another good reason why this product has such a low rating: It is very important that you read their documents, you are giving away too many rights! It is a binding contract! This product is controlling the water supply to your home! The only way you can read the terms and conditions to use the app and connected products is to download the Moen Flo-Smart Water Monitor app on your phone, go through some procedures, and then good luck trying to read the tiny print of the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for the Moen Mobile Applications and Connected Products on your phone. I called Moen to request a link (can\u2019t find it online) so I can read it on my computer. I also printed it up, 13 pages of double-space 12 font text. Some examples: Section 6 (i): \u201cYou are giving Moen and its designees perpetual, irrevocable\u2026..right to exploit the User Content and any person\u2019s property (physical, personal, and indicia) contained therein\u2026\u2026without any payment or other consideration of any kind\u2026..\u201d Section 9.

I wasted a lot of my time researching the product, wasted a plumber\u2019s time to come out and tell me how much to install it, packing it up to send it back, and gave up reading the rest of this nonsense.
